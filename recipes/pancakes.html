    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl.
        Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix
        until smooth.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop
        the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each
        pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3
        minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with
        remaining batter.
